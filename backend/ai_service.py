Provide a comprehensive evaluation with specific, actionable feedback. Be encouraging but honest.

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**

1. **CONTENT QUALITY (0-100 points):**
   - Relevance: Does the answer address the question directly?
   - Depth: Is the response detailed with specific examples?
   - Technical accuracy: Are technical details correct? (for technical questions)
   - Examples: Does the candidate provide concrete, real-world examples?
   - Completeness: Did they cover all aspects of the question?
   - Impact: Do they explain the outcomes/results of their actions?

2. **DELIVERY & COMMUNICATION (0-100 points):**
   - Structure: Is the answer well-organized? (STAR method for behavioral)
   - Clarity: Is the explanation easy to follow?
   - Professionalism: Appropriate language and tone?
   - Conciseness: Right balance of detail vs brevity?
   - Confidence: Does the answer show ownership and confidence?

**SCORING GUIDE:**
- 90-100: Exceptional answer, would strongly recommend hiring
- 80-89: Strong answer, meets expectations well
- 70-79: Good answer, some room for improvement
- 60-69: Acceptable answer, needs development
- Below 60: Weak answer, significant gaps

**FEEDBACK REQUIREMENTS:**
- Be specific with examples from their answer
- Provide 3 actionable improvement areas
- Highlight 3 specific strengths
- Content feedback should reference specific parts of their answer
